  - q: "What is Computer Vision Syndrome?"
    a: "Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) is a group of eye and vision-related problems caused by prolonged screen use. Symptoms include eye fatigue, dryness, burning, and blurred vision. It affects up to 90% of people who work at screens for more than 3 hours daily."
  - q: "How does the 20-20-20 rule work?"
    a: "Every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet (6 meters) away for 20 seconds. This gives your eye muscles a brief rest from constant close-range focusing on the screen."
  - q: "Does blue light from screens damage your eyes?"
    a: "Blue light from screens does not cause permanent eye damage according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. However, it can contribute to eye fatigue and disrupt sleep by suppressing melatonin production in the evening."
  - q: "How often should you blink when working at a computer?"
    a: "You should aim for 15-20 blinks per minute. During screen work, most people blink only 5-7 times per minute — a 66% reduction that leads to dry, irritated eyes."

## Why do eyes suffer during long hours of computer work?

Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) affects up to **90% of people** who work at screens for more than 3 hours daily. Symptoms include eye fatigue, dryness, burning, headaches, and blurred vision.

The average office worker spends **7-9 hours a day** in front of a screen. This means the muscles responsible for accommodation (focus changes) work almost non-stop, while blinking frequency drops drastically — from the normal 15-20 times per minute to just 5-7.

According to the **American Optometric Association**, this problem will only grow — by 2030, the number of people spending more than 6 hours daily in front of screens is expected to increase by 25%. That's why building eye-protective habits is more important than ever.

The following 7 habits are proven methods to reduce eye strain without giving up computer work.

## How does the 20-20-20 rule protect your eyes?

The 20-20-20 rule is the simplest and most well-researched way to protect your vision at the computer. Every **20 minutes**, look at something at least **20 feet** (~6 meters) away for **20 seconds**. This gives your eye muscles a brief rest from constant close-range focusing.

Research published in *Contact Lens and Anterior Eye* found that people who followed the 20-20-20 rule reported **40% fewer symptoms** of Computer Vision Syndrome after 4 weeks.

The problem is that **nobody remembers** to take regular breaks during intense work. That's why automatic reminders — like those in [HealthDesk](https://healthdesk.site/en/) — are essential. The app discreetly notifies you every 20 minutes and guides you through short eye exercises with animations.

## Why should you blink more often when working at a screen?

During computer work, we blink **66% less** than normal. This leads to insufficient corneal moisturization, dryness, and irritation — symptoms that worsen over time and can lead to chronic dry eye syndrome.

Conscious blinking every few minutes prevents these problems. A simple technique: every time you glance at your taskbar or clock, blink 3-5 times slowly and deliberately. This doesn't require interrupting your work but significantly improves eye hydration.

Research from *Ophthalmology Journal* confirms that simply being reminded to blink increases blinking frequency by **45%** and reduces dry eye symptoms.

## How should you position your monitor to protect your eyesight?

Improper monitor positioning is one of the main causes of eye fatigue. A screen placed too high, too low, or too close forces your eye and neck muscles to strain simultaneously.

- **Distance:** 50-70 cm from your eyes (arm's length)
- **Height:** top of the monitor at **eye level** or slightly below — looking slightly downward reduces the eye surface area exposed to tear evaporation
- **Angle:** slight backward tilt (10-20°)
- **Font size:** if you find yourself leaning toward the screen, increase your font size — it's simpler than changing the distance

## Does blue light from screens actually harm your eyes?

Blue light from screens does not cause permanent eye damage — this myth has been debunked by the **American Academy of Ophthalmology**. However, excessive evening exposure disrupts melatonin production and worsens sleep quality, which indirectly affects eye recovery.

Practical solutions:
- Enable **night mode** in your system (Night Shift on macOS, Night Light on Windows) — automatically from sunset
- Blue light filtering glasses — may help with sensitive eyes, though scientific evidence is mixed
- **Reduce screen brightness** in the evening — match brightness to your surroundings

## What eye exercises best protect your vision at the computer?

Regular exercises strengthen eye muscles and improve accommodation flexibility. Just **2-3 minutes** per hour is enough to feel the difference.

- **Eye movements** — slow movements up/down, left/right, circles in both directions (5 reps each)
- **Focus changes** — alternately looking at a close object (finger 30 cm from your nose) and a distant object (outside the window) for 10 seconds each
- **Palming** — close your eyes and cover them with warm palms for 30 seconds — darkness and warmth relax tired muscles
- **Figure eights** — trace a figure-8 shape on its side with your eyes, 5 times in each direction

[HealthDesk](https://healthdesk.site/en/) offers guided eye exercise sessions with animations and a timer — just click "Start" and the app guides you through the entire set.

## How does hydration affect eye health?

Dehydration directly worsens tear production, leading to **dry, irritated eyes**. Tears are 98% water — when your body is dehydrated, the first signal is often eye discomfort, not thirst.

- Drink at least **8 glasses of water** daily (about 2 liters)
- Keep a water bottle within reach — a visible bottle increases intake by up to 25%
- Avoid excess coffee and diuretic beverages — they dehydrate the body

[HealthDesk](https://healthdesk.site/en/) has a built-in hydration tracker that regularly reminds you to drink water — especially useful when you're focused on work and forget the basics.

## Why does proper room lighting protect your eyes?

Your screen shouldn't be the only light source in the room. Working in darkness with a bright monitor forces your pupils to constantly dilate and constrict, leading to faster eye fatigue.

- **Diffused light from the side** — the best setup is a window to the left or right of your monitor
- **No glare** — avoid positioning your screen opposite a window or under a lamp aimed at the screen
- **Brightness ratio:** surroundings should be at **20-50%** of your screen brightness

Research from the *Journal of Environmental Psychology* indicates that workers with well-matched office lighting report **30% fewer headaches** and less eye fatigue.

## Summary

Eye care at the computer isn't a one-time change — it's a **set of daily habits**. The 20-20-20 rule, conscious blinking, eye exercises, proper monitor positioning, and regular hydration are the foundations of healthy vision during long hours of screen work.
