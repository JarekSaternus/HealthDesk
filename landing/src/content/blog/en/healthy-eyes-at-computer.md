## Why Do Eyes Suffer at the Computer?

The average office worker spends **7-9 hours a day** in front of a screen. This means our eyes perform thousands of micro-movements, and the muscles responsible for accommodation (focus changes) work almost non-stop.

The result? **Computer Vision Syndrome** (CVS) — affecting up to 90% of people who work at screens for more than 3 hours daily.

## 7 Habits for Healthy Eyes

### 1. The 20-20-20 Rule

Every **20 minutes**, look at something **20 feet** (~6 meters) away for **20 seconds**. This gives your eye muscles a moment to rest.

> HealthDesk automatically reminds you about this rule — just select the 20-20-20 work method in settings.

### 2. Blink More Often

When working at a screen, we blink **66% less** than normal. Consciously blinking every few minutes prevents dryness and irritation.

### 3. Position Your Screen Correctly

The top of your monitor should be at **eye level** or slightly below. Distance from the screen: **50-70 cm** (arm's length).

### 4. Reduce Blue Light

Enable **night mode** in your operating system (Night Shift on macOS, Night Light on Windows). This is especially important in the evening — blue light disrupts melatonin production.

### 5. Proper Lighting

Avoid **glare on your screen**. The best lighting is diffused, coming from the side. Your screen shouldn't be the only light source in the room.

### 6. Eye Exercises

Regular exercises strengthen eye muscles:
- **Eye movements** — up/down, left/right, circles
- **Focus changes** — alternately looking at near and far objects
- **Palming** — close your eyes and cover them with warm palms for 30 seconds

> HealthDesk offers guided eye exercise sessions with animations and a timer.

### 7. Stay Hydrated

Dehydration reduces tear production, leading to **dry, irritated eyes**. Drink at least **8 glasses of water** daily.

## Summary

Eye care isn't about a one-time change — it's about **daily habits**. The 20-20-20 rule, regular exercises, and proper hydration are the foundations of healthy vision at the computer.

HealthDesk automates these habits — it reminds you about breaks, guides eye exercises, and tracks hydration. [Download for free](https://healthdesk.site/en/#download) and start taking care of your eyes today.
