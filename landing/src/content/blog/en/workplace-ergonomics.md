## Why Ergonomics Matter

**80% of office workers** experience back, neck, or wrist pain. Most of these problems stem from improper posture at the desk — and they're preventable.

## Monitor

- **Distance:** 50-70 cm from your eyes (arm's length)
- **Height:** top of screen at eye level
- **Angle:** slight backward tilt (10-20°)
- **Brightness:** matched to surroundings — not too bright, not too dim

## Chair

- **Feet:** flat on the floor (or on a footrest)
- **Knees:** bent at ~90°
- **Back:** supported by the backrest with lumbar support
- **Arms:** forearms parallel to the floor

## Desk

- **Height:** elbows at desk level with shoulders relaxed
- **Space:** enough room for mouse and keyboard
- **Standing desk:** if available, alternate positions every 30-60 minutes

## Regular Breaks

Even the best chair can't replace **movement**. Stand up every 25-52 minutes for a short break:
- Neck and shoulder stretches
- A short walk
- Eye exercises (20-20-20 rule)

Good ergonomics is an **investment in health**. Proper positioning of your monitor, chair, and desk plus regular breaks are the key to comfortable, pain-free computer work.
