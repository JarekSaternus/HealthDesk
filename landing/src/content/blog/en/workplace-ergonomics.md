  - q: "What is the optimal distance between your eyes and the monitor?"
    a: "The optimal distance is 50-70 cm (about arm's length). The top of the screen should be at eye level or slightly below to minimize neck and eye strain."
  - q: "How often should you stand up from your desk?"
    a: "You should stand up every 25-52 minutes for a short break lasting 5-17 minutes. Regular position changes prevent back and neck pain."
  - q: "Is a standing desk better than a regular desk?"
    a: "A standing desk is not inherently better — the key is regularly alternating between sitting and standing every 30-60 minutes. Research shows this reduces lower back discomfort by 32%."

## Why does workplace ergonomics matter?

Proper computer workstation ergonomics reduces the risk of chronic back, neck, and wrist pain by up to 60%. **80% of office workers** experience these issues, and most of them stem from improper posture at the desk.

According to a report by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), musculoskeletal disorders are the most common cause of sick leave in EU countries. A properly set up workstation isn't a luxury — it's a foundation of health prevention.

Even small adjustments — moving your monitor, adjusting chair height, or changing the screen angle — can bring noticeable relief within the first week. Below you'll find specific guidelines for each element of your workstation.

## How should you position your computer monitor?

The monitor is the element that most strongly affects your posture at the desk. A poorly positioned screen forces you to lean your head forward, generating strain on neck muscles — up to 12 kg of additional pressure at a 30° head tilt.

- **Distance:** 50-70 cm from your eyes (arm's length)
- **Height:** top of the screen at eye level or slightly below
- **Angle:** slight backward tilt (10-20°)
- **Brightness:** matched to surroundings — not too bright, not too dim
- **Glare:** avoid placing the screen opposite a window; light should come from the side

If you work on a laptop, consider a laptop stand and an external keyboard. It's one of the most effective ergonomic changes at minimal cost.

## How should you set up your office chair to avoid back pain?

Proper chair setup is the foundation of ergonomics. Poor lumbar support leads to strain on the lower spine — the most common cause of back pain in office workers.

- **Feet:** flat on the floor (or on a footrest if the desk is too high)
- **Knees:** bent at 90-110° — knees should not be higher than hips
- **Back:** supported by the backrest with lumbar support — if your chair doesn't have it, use a lumbar cushion
- **Arms:** forearms parallel to the floor, elbows bent at ~90°
- **Shoulders:** relaxed, not raised

Research published in the *Spine Journal* found that workers using chairs with adjustable lumbar support reported **40% less lower back pain** after 6 months.

## What should a computer desk look like?

A properly sized desk allows you to maintain a natural body position without straining your arm and wrist muscles. A desk that's too high forces your shoulders up, and one that's too low forces you to lean forward.

- **Height:** elbows at desk level with shoulders relaxed (standard 72-75 cm, varies by height)
- **Space:** enough room for mouse and keyboard — wrists should not rest on the desk edge
- **Depth:** at least 60 cm so the monitor sits at the proper distance
- **Standing desk:** if available, alternate positions every 30-60 minutes — don't stand all day

Research from the *British Medical Journal* shows that alternating between sitting and standing during the workday reduces lumbar discomfort by **32%** and improves workers' subjective well-being.

## Why are regular breaks more important than the perfect chair?

Even the best-configured workstation can't replace movement. A static position — even a correct one — held for hours leads to weakening of deep stabilizing muscles and joint stiffness. Regular micro-breaks interrupt this cycle.

The recommended rhythm is standing up every **25-52 minutes** for a short break:

- Neck and shoulder stretches (30 seconds)
- A short walk around the room or hallway (2-3 minutes)
- [Eye exercises](https://healthdesk.site/en/blog/healthy-eyes-at-computer/) using the 20-20-20 rule
- Breathing exercises — even a 60-second box breathing session reduces muscle tension

[HealthDesk](https://healthdesk.site/en/) automatically reminds you about breaks and guides you through [stretching exercises](https://healthdesk.site/en/blog/desk-exercises-for-back-pain/) step by step, matched to your break duration. The app also detects inactivity and automatically pauses timers when you step away from the computer.

## How can you create an ergonomic checklist for your workstation?

This checklist lets you verify your workstation meets basic ergonomic principles in 5 minutes:

- ✅ Monitor at arm's length, top of screen at eye level
- ✅ Chair with lumbar support, feet flat on the floor
- ✅ Elbows at desk level, shoulders relaxed
- ✅ No glare on the screen, lighting from the side
- ✅ Timer or app reminding you about breaks every 25-52 min
- ✅ Water bottle within reach

If even one point is missing — it's worth fixing today. Even a single correction can reduce discomfort within days.

## Summary

Good workplace ergonomics is an **investment in health** that pays off through less pain, better focus, and higher productivity. Proper positioning of your monitor, chair, and desk combined with regular breaks is the proven path to comfortable, pain-free computer work.
